# TechCrush DS Task 3 Coursework
Every day, transactions happen especially with a basic amenity such as **FOOD**.

Pizza is one of the leading , in 2015, J & H Pizza hut documented every transaction, hoping to draw insights from transactions made.

This data set originally considers 4 data sets — *order_details*, *orders*, *pizza_types*, *pizzas*, which I have merged into one Data set – *All Pizza*.

Following preprocessing of the original datasets, I have answered the following questions:
- Total revenue/sales?
- Total quantity sold.
- Total orders taken.
- Number of pizza types sold.
- Average price of the pizzas.
- Peak hours of sales (in terms of revenue and in terms of orders taken).
- Total sales made on each day of the week. The day of the week sales are made the most (in terms of revenue and in terms of orders taken).
- Top 5 bestselling pizzas.
- Sales made in each month. And noticable trends

I have also used Markdowns to document my process and draw my inferences.
